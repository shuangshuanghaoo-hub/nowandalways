    <h1>Stuff We Didn't Know Where to Put</h1>

    <p>This page is a drawer. An attic. A coat pocket full of notes.  
    It’s where fragments land when they don’t fit elsewhere. It’s where memory leaks.  
    We don’t organize this page. That’s kind of the point.</p>

      <h2>💬 Unsent Letter Fragment</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I was going to tell you how I felt that night, but the words got shy.  
        So I kissed you instead. In a line break.  
        I think you felt it.</p>

      <h2>📎 Scrap</h2>
      <p>"We are not perfect, we are preserved." — written on a napkin, never used.</p>

    <p>We’ll keep tossing things in here.  
    Feel free to dig through. Just… be gentle.</p>
